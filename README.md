### An enhanced .NET version of the tool that preserved GoAnimate's assets.
This tool rips assets for GoAnimate's "themes" and prepares them for immediate use in a server emulator program such as GoAnimate Wrapper, or in Adobe Animate for custom assets.
### Improvements compared to prior versions
- Refactored code, allowing for increased effeciency and easy modification.
- Customizable but easy-to-use interface. Rip only what you want, how you want it!
- Portable! All you need is an executable!
- Error reporting! No more "Forbidden" files!
- Decryption automated! Simply flip it on and you'll never have to worry about encryption.
- Re-encryption, for changing the encryption key out (incase you need it for old builds).
- Both standard and character creator themes fully rippable!
- JPEXS auto decompilation support! Decompile a theme all at once, and never worry about it again! (Requires JPEXS installation).
### Now rips ALL content, including...
- Music Variations.
- Vidget/Widget Thumbnails.
- Flow Frames.
- Starter Thumbnails.
- Category Thumbnails.
- Charparts.
