![GoAnimate Ripper2](./assets/logo.png)
#
### An enhanced .NET version of the tool that made programs such as GoAnimate Wrapper possible in the modern day.
This tool rips assets for GoAnimate's "themes" and prepares them for immediate use in a server emulator program such as GoAnimate Wrapper, or any other similar services.
### Improvements compared to prior versions
- Refactored code.
- Simple yet effective interface.
- More portable thanks to being compilable.
- Decryption automated! No key knowleddge necessary.
- Reencryption, for use in older builds (ie how it's used in FlashThemes).
- Character Creator support built in.
- WIP! JPEXS auto decompilation support (slow).
### Now rips more stuff! (FlashThemes has made me realize my OG Ripper missed a good chunk of stuff...)
- Music Variations.
- Vidget/Widget Thumbnails.
- Flow Frames.
### Stuff to keep in mind
- A good chunk of the themes are ***LARGE***. Only use this tool if you have the space for it.
- `charparts` need to be ripped manually. As far as I know, they are partially hardcoded.
### Support
Contact me on Discord if you need help using this program (my handle is izjay).
