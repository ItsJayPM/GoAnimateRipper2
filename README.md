# GoAnimateRipper2
### An enhanced executable version of the tool that made programs such as GoAnimate Wrapper possible in the modern day.
This tool rips assets for GoAnimate's "themes" and prepares them for immediate use in a server emulator program such as GoAnimate Wrapper, or any other similar services.
### Improvements compared to prior versions
- Refactored code
- Simple yet effective interface
- More portable thanks to being compilable
- Automated Decryption built in as an option
### Now rips more stuff! (Wrapper 2 has made me realize my OG Ripper missed a good chunk of stuff...)
- Music Variations
- Vidget/Widget Thumbnails
- Flow Frames
### Stuff to keep in mind
- A good chunk of the themes are ***LARGE***. Only use this tool if you have the space for it.
- This tool does not currently support `cc_theme`s. For that functionality, refer to the old code available elsewhere.
- `charparts` need to be ripped manually. As far as I know, they are partially hardcoded, and require some aspects of `cc_theme`s to be implemented.
